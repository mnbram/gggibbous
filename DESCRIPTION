Description: Moon charts are like pie charts except that the proportions are
    shown as crescent or gibbous portions of a circle, like the lit and unlit
    portions of the moon. As such, they work best with only one or two groups.
    gggibbous extends ggplot2 to allow for plotting multiple moon charts in a
    single panel and does not require a square coordinate system.
Depends:
    R (>= 3.6.0),
    ggplot2 (>= 3.2.1)
